## Inspiration
We wanted to change the way that students in the computer science major and beyond can find the courses that they need to take in order to fulfill the major; we wanted to make this process more streamlined and presented in a logical progression to the students.

## What it does
Our website takes in courses that the user has already taken, and returns immediate course recommendations based upon several criteria: user skill level, major requirements, and prerequisites met. It also displays the completion status for the major requirements on the right side so that the user knows which categories they are missing.

## How we built it
We used Java as the backend to form the recommendations and handle all the logic taking user inputs. HTML and Javascript were used to form the user interface of the website. Spring Boot was used to facilitate data transfer between the front-end and back-end.
